Users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

With this project I was able to work on the moblie-first workflow and further adjust the code to fit across all devices to deliver a great responsive web product/services. I was able to work on the flexbox structure and min-hieght to set the body of the in the center of all devices.

### Continued Development

On future projects I will focus on using the CSS Grid layout instead of Flexbox layout in order to excel at both layouts. The CSS Grid layout is a two-dimensional layout that is more complex than Flexbox and learning it will further improve my CSS skills. I will also continue to refine my responsive web design skills in order to execute it in a quicker manner.
